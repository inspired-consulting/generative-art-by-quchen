# Differential equations

Plotting the solutions of [differential equations][de] is an amazing way to
generate computer graphics, provided one has the necessary mathematical
background.

## 2-body problem

Here is a planet orbiting the sun. It has two forces acting on it,

- Slightly stronger gravity (r^{-2.95} instead of r^{-2}) to introduce precession
- Friction to spiral inwards

The modifications were simply for artistic purposes and have no basis in real physics.

## Double pendulum

The double pendulum is one of the simplest chaotic systems in physics. Here is the trajectory of one:

## Noise pendulum

This is the phase space of a pendulum subject to

- Linear friction
- Gaussian noise
- External sinusoidal force
- Gravity :-)
