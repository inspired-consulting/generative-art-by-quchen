# Hexagonal coordinates

The best resource on the web to basic hexagonal coordinate systems is
[Red Blob Games][hex-article] interactive (!) writeup on the topic.

We use cubical/axial coordinates here. This is what the hexagonal plane looks
like, with the coordinates `r` `s` and `t` filled in. Note that `r+s+t=0`,
always.

Hexagons allow an interesting discrete view on things, so in the following
picture, we have a blue line and a circle of radius 2 around (-1, 1, 0) in
yellow.
