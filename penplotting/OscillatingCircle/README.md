Kilometer
=========

How long is one kilometer?

This simple picture puts x-parallell lines of a defined total length onto a
piece of paper. One project possible with this is visualizing just how much ink
is in a standard ball point pen.

```bash
# Paint 10m onto A4
stack run kilometer -- --a4 --landscape --length 10
```
