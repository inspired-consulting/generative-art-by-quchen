(
-- * Types
--
-- A Voronoi pattern is constructed from a list of seeds:
-- Each seed is surrounded by a polygon so that the distance of all
-- points in the polygon is closer to the seed than to any other
-- seed in the plane.
--
-- The phyiscal analogon is crystallization around a nucleus: Starting from a
-- nucleus, the crystal grows in every direction, until it hits the crystal
-- structure of another nucleus.

-- | Add a new seed point to a Voronoi pattern.
--
-- The algorithm works as follows:
--
--     * For all existing cells, remove the portion that is nearer to the new
--       seed than to the seed of the cell.
--     * For the new cell, start with the largest possible area ('bounds'), and
--       iterate over all existing seeds and remove the portion that is
--       nearer to the other seed.
--
-- The new cell is then inserted, and together with the clipped existing cells
-- it will cover the area exactly without gaps or overlap.
--
-- Note that this algorithm is pretty simple, but also inefficient, since most
-- of the existing cells don't have any overlap with the new cell, so we do a
-- a lot of unnecessary checks. The algorithm runs in O(nÂ²) time.
